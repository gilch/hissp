# Hissp Documentation
This directory contains the reStructuredText source of Hissp's documentation,
along with associated configuration and helper files,
including the Lissp syntax highlighter.
A significant additional portion of Hissp's rendered documentation is derived from
docstrings in Hissp's source code (the API docs).
