## Conduct
To encourage participation,
we strive to maintain an environment conducive to cooperation and
collaborative effort. To that end, note that
GitHub's acceptable use and conduct restrictions apply to this repo as well.
Spamming, doxing, harassment, etc. will not be tolerated.
Belligerent users may be blocked at the discretion of the project
maintainer, even on the first offense.
Issues that become heated or veer too far off topic may be closed or locked.
### good faith
Software Engineers are an eccentric bunch who come from various
generational and world cultures.
Tone is notoriously hard to convey in writing and for many English is
not their first language.
Therefore, before you reply in anger, please
[assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)
until there is very obvious evidence to the contrary.
### professional detachment
You are free to criticize code, documentation, PRs, philosophy, ideas,
and so on, if relevant to the project, but not each other.
Discussion here should be focused on the work, not the people doing it.
This is not the forum for status games.
Contributions alone demonstrate competence.
Issue posts stereotyping, psychoanalyzing, or otherwise categorizing people 
beyond legitimate project roles
(or other such veiled insults, even if spun in a "positive" light)
including similar attempts to aggrandize oneself
(even if spun as self-deprecating)
are, at the very least, off-topic, and subject to moderator action.
### disputes
While consensus based on stated project goals is usually preferable,
the maintainer is the final arbiter for the project.
He may reinterpret goals, instate rules, and reject contributions.
Even if you disagree with his decision,
you may always make a fork as permitted by the LICENSE.
Just don't call it Hissp (see section 6 of the LICENSE).
